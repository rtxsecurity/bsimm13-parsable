Goals, roles, responsibilities, and activities are explicitly defined. Most organizations examine existing methodologies, such as the NIST SSDF, Microsoft SDL, or Synopsys Touchpoints, then tailor them to meet their needs. Security activities will be adapted to software lifecycle processes (e.g., waterfall, Agile, CI/CD, DevOps), so activities will evolve with both the organization and the security landscape. The process doesn't need to be publicly promoted outside the firm to have the desired impact (see [SM3.2]). In addition to publishing the written process, some firms also automate parts (e.g., a testing strategy) as governance-as-code (see [SM3.4]).",

The first two steps toward establishing security-specific checkpoint conditions are to identify process locations that are compatible with existing development practices and to then begin gathering the information necessary to make a go/no-go decision, such as risk-ranking thresholds or defect data. Importantly, the conditions need not be enforced at this stage--for example, the SSG can collect security testing results for each project prior to release, then provide their informed opinion on what constitutes sufficient testing or acceptable test results without trying to stop a project from moving forward (see [SM2.2]). Shorter release cycles might require creative approaches to collecting the right evidence and rely heavily on automation. Socializing the conditions and then enforcing them once most project teams already know how to succeed is a gradual approach that motivates good behavior without introducing unnecessary friction.",

Verifying conditions yields data that informs the KRIs and any other metrics used to govern the process. Automatically giving software a passing grade or granting exceptions without due consideration defeats the purpose of verifying conditions. Even seemingly innocuous software projects (e.g., small code changes, infrastructure access control changes, deployment blueprints) must successfully satisfy the prescribed security conditions as they progress through the software lifecycle. Similarly, APIs, frameworks, libraries, bespoke code, microservices, container configurations, and so on are all software that must satisfy security release conditions. It's possible, and often very useful, to have verified the conditions both before and after the development process itself.

Forming this social network of advocates, sometimes referred to as champions, is a good step toward scaling security into software engineering. One way to build the initial group is to track the people who stand out during introductory training courses (see [T3.6]). Another way is to ask for volunteers. In a more top-down approach, initial satellite membership is assigned to ensure good coverage of development groups, but ongoing membership is based on actual performance. The satellite can act as a sounding board for new projects and, in new or fast-moving technology areas, help combine software security skills with domain knowledge that might be under-represented in the SSG or engineering teams. Agile coaches, scrum masters, and DevOps engineers can make particularly useful satellite members, especially for detecting and removing process friction.

The sign-off policy might, for example, also require the accountable person to acknowledge critical vulnerabilities that have not been mitigated or SSDL steps that have been skipped. Informal or uninformed risk acceptance alone isn't a security sign-off because the act of accepting risk is more effective when it's formalized (e.g., with a signature, a form submission, or something similar) and captured for future reference. Similarly, simply stating that certain projects don't need sign-off at all won't achieve the desired risk management results. In some cases, however, the risk owner can provide the sign-off on a particular set of software project acceptance criteria, which are then implemented in automation to provide governance-as-code (see [SM3.4]), but there must be an ongoing verification that the criteria remain accurate, and the automation is working.",

The idea here is to push attack capability past what typical commercial tools and offerings encompass, then make that knowledge and technology easy for others to use.

These standards are necessarily specific to a programming language, and they can address the use of popular frameworks, APIs, libraries, and infrastructure automation. Secure coding standards can also be for low- or no-code platforms (e.g., Microsoft Power Apps, Salesforce Lightning). While enforcement isn't the point at this stage (see [CR3.5]), violation of standards is a teachable moment for all stakeholders. Other useful coding standards topics include proper use of cloud APIs, use of approved cryptography, memory sanitization, banned functions, open source use, and many others. If the organization already has coding standards for other purposes, its secure coding standards should build upon them. A clear set of secure coding standards is a good way to guide both manual and automated code review, as well as to provide relevant examples for security training. Some groups might choose to integrate their secure coding standards directly into automation. Socializing the benefits of following standards is also a good first step to gaining widespread acceptance (see [SM2.7]).",

In cloud environments, hardened configurations likely include up-to-date security patches, security configuration, and security services, such as logging and monitoring. In traditional on- premises IT deployments, a stack might include an operating system, a database, an application server, and a runtime environment (e.g., a LAMP stack).

For example, threat modeling would identify both a system that was subject to escalation of privilege attacks because of broken access control as well as a mobile application that incorrectly puts PII in local storage. Use of the firm's secure-by-design components often streamlines this process (see [SFD2.1]). Many modern applications are no longer simply \"3-tier\" but instead involve components architected to interact across a variety of tiers--browser/endpoint, embedded, web, microservices, orchestration engines, deployment pipelines, third-party SaaS, and so on.

Rather than security feature guidance, a design review should produce a set of flaws and a plan to mitigate them. An organization can use consultants to do this work, but it should participate actively. A review focused only on whether a software project has performed the right process steps won't generate useful results about flaws.

        "description": "Provide external bug reporters with a line of communication to internal security experts through a low-friction, public entry point. These experts work with bug reporters to invoke any necessary organizational responses and to coordinate with the external entities throughout the defect management lifecycle. Successful disclosure processes require insight from internal stakeholders such as legal, marketing, and public relations roles to simplify and expedite decision-making during software security crises. Although bug bounties might be important to motivate some researchers (see [CMVM3.4]), proper public attribution and a low-friction reporting process is often sufficient motivation for researchers to participate in a coordinated disclosure. Most organizations will use a combination of easy-to-find landing pages, common email addresses (security@), and embedded product documentation when appropriate (security. txt) as an entry point for external reporters to invoke this process.",

        "description": "Operations standards and procedures proactively minimize application attack surfaces by using attack intelligence and application weakness data to limit vulnerable conditions. Finding and fixing software bugs in operations is important (see [CMVM1.2]) but so is finding and fixing errors in cloud security models, VPNs, segmentation, security configurations for networks, hosts, and applications, and so on to limit the ability to successfully attack deployed applications. Combining attack intelligence (see [AM1.5]) with information about software assets (see [AM3.3]) and a continuous view of application weaknesses helps ensure that attack surface management keeps pace with attacker methods. SBOMs (see [SE3.6]) are also an important information source when doing attack surface management in a crisis.",
